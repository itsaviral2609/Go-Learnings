package main

/*

Concurrency: -------> Parts of the program may exceute independently in some non-deterministic order (partial) order
Parallelism: -------> Parts of the program execute independently at the same time!

RACE CONDITION:

System behaviour depends on the (non-deterministic) sequence or timing of parts of the program executing independently,where
some possible behaviours (order of execution) produce invalid results!
